# 2D Platformer - 1 d'Octubre Studios

## Description

A simple platformer with levels created with Tiled. There is an animated character moving 
around while being able to save and load the game's state. It also has two new enemies a flying and a ground type that can jump, to kill both of them you have to jump on top of them. Also has a level 2 now. 

some notes: there is no dying scene because we wanted to make a similar game like supermeatboy so it makes it faster
